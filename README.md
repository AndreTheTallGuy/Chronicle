# Chronicle

Chronicle aims to overcome the limitations of the company's existing storage solutions by compartmentalizing the documents and videos utilized solely by the Training Team. Chronicle enables members of the Training Team to upload arbitrarily large text and video files and organize filter and search the documents and videos through resource tagging. Users of the application can optionally mark items uploaded as private only to them or private to a specific subset of users.
